# Colorado

A TSV spreadsheet. **Colorado** allows to visualize and edit CSV and TSV files. It is able to import a file specifying the delimiter character, but the program will infer the format by itself in the 90% of cases.

Concepts:
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">TSV</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>

## Installation

In order for **Colorado** to work correctly, it will need **dotnet** and **Gtk** installed.

Technologies:
- <a href="http://www.dotnet.microsoft.com">dotnet 9.0 runtime</a>.
- <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk 3</a>.

Then, go to the [Colorado's releases section](http://github.com/baltasarq/Colorado/releases/latest) and grab the *Testy.dll* file.

## Execution:

Just open a terminal and type:

```
$ dotnet Colorado.dll
```

# Compilation
